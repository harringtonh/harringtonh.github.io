    <h2 style="color:green;"> Sarah’s Sweet Challah </h2>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp honey</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Makes one loaf of the size pictured above; that’s about 14-16 inches long. </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Directions:</p>
      <p>
      With bread machine:
      Combine solids (flour, salt, and sugar) then liquids (oil, honey, egg, and water) in the bread machine pan. Add yeast last, or in the yeast dispenser. Put on the dough setting. (This will finish the first rise).
      Remove the dough from the machine and punch it down. Separate the dough into equal 4 parts, and roll out into a log (I find squeezing into a log often to be easier). Braid the loaf. Place the loaf on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
      Mist with water (I usually just sprinkle with my fingers), cover loosely (plastic wrap or a towel, though sometimes a towel sticks), place in a warm place (I heat my oven to like 95 and then put it in) and let rise until doubled in size-- usually 1 to 1 ½ hours.  
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
      Beat one egg--you can add a tsp of water if you want. Brush the loaf with this egg wash.
      Bake for 20-25 minutes-- until the loaf sounds hollow when you tap on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
      Without bread machine:
      Dissolve yeast in water with a pinch of sugar-- let stand until frothy on top (5-10 minutes).
      Combine dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar) in a bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add wet ingredients (egg, oil, honey); beat them together into a slurry. Only small amounts of flour should be added at this step.
      Add the yeast into the wet ingredients. Mix the whole thing with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
      Mix with a dough hook/mixer for 6-8 minutes on low speed, or turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead dough for 10 minutes. If the dough seems very sticky, add teaspoons of flour until it seems tacky, but not crazy stretchy like bubblegum. It’s done when it is smooth and can hold shape as a ball.
      Let the challah rise for 1 to 1 ½ hours, until doubled in bulk. 
      From here, it’s the same as after having removed dough from the bread machine -- see from step 2 above.

        <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>

      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Directions:</p>
      <p>
      1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x5 inch loaf pan with cooking spray.
      2. In a large bowl, add the grated zucchini, sugar, brown sugar, applesauce, oil, eggs, and
      vanilla. Whisk until well combined.
      3. Add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Stir just until no dry flour
      remains, trying not to over mix.
      4. Pour the batter into the loaf pan. Bake for 50 to 54 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the
      center of the bread should come out with moist crumbs on it.
      5. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then eat warm!
