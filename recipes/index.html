    <h2 style="color:green;"> Sarah’s Sweet Challah </h2>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp honey</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Makes one loaf of the size pictured above; that’s about 14-16 inches long. </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Directions:</p>
      <p>
      With bread machine:
      Combine solids (flour, salt, and sugar) then liquids (oil, honey, egg, and water) in the bread machine pan. Add yeast last, or in the yeast dispenser. Put on the dough setting. (This will finish the first rise).
      Remove the dough from the machine and punch it down. Separate the dough into equal 4 parts, and roll out into a log (I find squeezing into a log often to be easier). Braid the loaf. Place the loaf on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
      Mist with water (I usually just sprinkle with my fingers), cover loosely (plastic wrap or a towel, though sometimes a towel sticks), place in a warm place (I heat my oven to like 95 and then put it in) and let rise until doubled in size-- usually 1 to 1 ½ hours.  
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
      Beat one egg--you can add a tsp of water if you want. Brush the loaf with this egg wash.
      Bake for 20-25 minutes-- until the loaf sounds hollow when you tap on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
      Without bread machine:
      Dissolve yeast in water with a pinch of sugar-- let stand until frothy on top (5-10 minutes).
      Combine dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar) in a bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add wet ingredients (egg, oil, honey); beat them together into a slurry. Only small amounts of flour should be added at this step.
      Add the yeast into the wet ingredients. Mix the whole thing with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
      Mix with a dough hook/mixer for 6-8 minutes on low speed, or turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead dough for 10 minutes. If the dough seems very sticky, add teaspoons of flour until it seems tacky, but not crazy stretchy like bubblegum. It’s done when it is smooth and can hold shape as a ball.
      Let the challah rise for 1 to 1 ½ hours, until doubled in bulk. 
      From here, it’s the same as after having removed dough from the bread machine -- see from step 2 above.

      <p>
      1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
      2. Cut out a circle of parchment paper to fit the bottom of a 10-inch tart pan with a removal bottom. Grease the tart pan generously with butter. Place the parchment circle in the bottom of the pan and grease that generously with butter as well.
      3. In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together eggs, caster sugar, and vanilla until slightly pale and aerated.
      4. With a spoon or rubber spatula, stir in salt, lemon zest, cinnamon, almond flour, and hazelnut flour. Set aside. 
      5. Pour batter into your prepared tart pan and place that on a baking sheet. Place into your preheated oven and bake for 30 minutes. 
      6. Remove cake from the oven and let it cool on a cooling rack for at least half an hour. Press up on the bottom of the tart pan, releasing the cake from the tart pan. Transfer cake back onto the cooling rack and if using the stencil, place in the middle of the cake. Dust generously with powdered sugar and remove stencil carefully to reveal the iconic cross in the center of your Tarta de Santiago.
