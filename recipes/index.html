    <h2 style="color:green;"> Sarah’s Sweet Challah </h2>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Ingredients:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ cups of bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ¼ tsp salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup canola oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ tsp honey</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon yeast</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Makes one loaf of the size pictured above; that’s about 14-16 inches long. </p>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Directions:</p>
      <p>
      With bread machine:
      Combine solids (flour, salt, and sugar) then liquids (oil, honey, egg, and water) in the bread machine pan. Add yeast last, or in the yeast dispenser. Put on the dough setting. (This will finish the first rise).
      Remove the dough from the machine and punch it down. Separate the dough into equal 4 parts, and roll out into a log (I find squeezing into a log often to be easier). Braid the loaf. Place the loaf on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
      Mist with water (I usually just sprinkle with my fingers), cover loosely (plastic wrap or a towel, though sometimes a towel sticks), place in a warm place (I heat my oven to like 95 and then put it in) and let rise until doubled in size-- usually 1 to 1 ½ hours.  
      Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
      Beat one egg--you can add a tsp of water if you want. Brush the loaf with this egg wash.
      Bake for 20-25 minutes-- until the loaf sounds hollow when you tap on the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
      Without bread machine:
      Dissolve yeast in water with a pinch of sugar-- let stand until frothy on top (5-10 minutes).
      Combine dry ingredients (flour, salt, sugar) in a bowl. Make a well in the dry ingredients and add wet ingredients (egg, oil, honey); beat them together into a slurry. Only small amounts of flour should be added at this step.
      Add the yeast into the wet ingredients. Mix the whole thing with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms.
      Mix with a dough hook/mixer for 6-8 minutes on low speed, or turn the dough out onto a floured work surface and knead dough for 10 minutes. If the dough seems very sticky, add teaspoons of flour until it seems tacky, but not crazy stretchy like bubblegum. It’s done when it is smooth and can hold shape as a ball.
      Let the challah rise for 1 to 1 ½ hours, until doubled in bulk. 
      From here, it’s the same as after having removed dough from the bread machine -- see from step 2 above.

        <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">COOKIE</p>
        <li>6 tablespoons/85 grams unsalted butter (browned)</li>
        <li>1 cup/220 grams packed brown sugar, light or dark</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1+1/4cups/160 grams all-purpose flour</li>

      </ul>
      <p style="color:rgb(113, 52, 255);">Directions:</p>
      <p>
      1. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease and line a 13-by-9-inch baking pan with parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on two sides.
      2. Prepare the brownie layer: In a medium saucepan brown the butter over medium heat for 10-12 minutes. While it cooks, the butter will foam, pop, and crackle. This is normal! Stand by and stir it occasionally. When the bottom of the pan has brown bits of butter solid and it starts to smell nutty, scrape all of it into a separate bowl.
      3. Add sugar and whisk vigorously until well combined.
      4. Once the mixture has cooled a bit, whisk in the eggs one at a time. Whisk in the vanilla.
      5. Add the flour, cocoa powder, espresso powder, cinnamon, baking powder and salt, and stir to combine. Transfer to a medium bowl.
      6. Prepare the cookie batter: Wash and dry the saucepan. brown the butter over medium heat for 10-12 minutes. While it cooks, the butter will foam, pop, and crackle. This is normal! Stand by and stir it occasionally. When the bottom of the pan has brown bits of butter solid and it starts to smell nutty, scrape all of it into a separate bowl.
      7. Add sugar and whisk vigorously until well combined.
      8. Once the mixture has cooled a bit, whisk in the eggs one at a time. Whisk in the vanilla. Add the flour, baking powder and salt, and stir. Stir in ¾ cup of the chocolate.
      9. Using two cookie scoops, drop each of the batters into the prepared pan. The pattern can be random, and one dough can be on top of the other; just make sure that once all the batter is added to the pan, you have an even thickness spread out across the pan. Sprinkle the remaining ½ cup chocolate on top.
      10. Bake until the top looks dry and set, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with moist crumbs attached, 20 to 22 minutes.
      11. Transfer to a rack to cool completely, about 45 minutes. Lift the bar out using the paper and transfer to a cutting board. Cut into bars to serve.
